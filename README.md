# 🌟 U1 Computer Vision Project 🌟

This repository contains the code and resources for the **U1 Computer Vision** project. The goal of this project is to classify various PC parts using deep learning techniques (CNN).

## 📋 Project Overview

The project involves:
- **Preprocessing** image data
- **Training** a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
- Using the trained model for **inference** on new images

The project integrates with [ClearML](https://clear.ml/) for experiment tracking and management.
